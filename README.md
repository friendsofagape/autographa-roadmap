# Autographa Roadmap
Autographa is a robust open-source editor designed primarily for aiding Bible Translation. This repository exists to document to maintain the current roadmap of Autographa and also track progress.

## Structure
Each roadmap item would ideally be modeled as a GitHub [`milestone`](https://github.com/friendsofagape/autographa-roadmap/milestones). 

Each `milestone` in-turn consists of one or more [`issues`](https://github.com/friendsofagape/autographa-roadmap/issues) which would cover the scope of work entailed to successfully complete the parent `milestone`. Sometimes a single `issue` may contain a list of links to `issues` in other relevant repositories. The `issues` are tagged with relevant information as well as assignees when meaningful to do so.

The [`Projects`](https://github.com/friendsofagape/autographa-roadmap/projects) gives a snapshot of the current state of the progress of the team's efforts.

The [`Discussions`](https://github.com/friendsofagape/autographa-roadmap/discussions) are a place for the community to ask questions, request/upvote features or generally engage in dialog.

## Contributing
All thoughts and feedback on the roadmap and general planning of features are welcome in this repository. Please create a new `Discussion` post or contribute to an existing one.

**Please do not** raise issues relating to bugs or other such code related queries in this repository. Those may be lodged in the code repository corresponding to the application/component (most probably found in [here](https://github.com/friendsofagape) or [here](https://github.com/Bridgeconn)).

Also, please be kind.
